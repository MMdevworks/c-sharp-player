#### Object-Oriented Principle #1:   
- Encapsulation — Combining data (fields) and the operations on that data (methods) into a well-defined unit (like a class).

#### Object-Oriented Principle #2: 
- Information Hiding — Only the object itself should directly access its data. (private/public)

#### Object-Oriented Principle #3: 
- Abstraction - The outside world does not need to know each object or class’s inner workings and can deal with it as an abstract concept. Abstraction allows the inner workings to change without affecting the outside world.

#### Object-Oriented Principle #4: 
- Inheritance — Basing one class on another, retaining the original class’s functionality while extending the new class with additional capabilities.

#### Object-Oriented Principle #5: 
- Polymorphism — Derived classes can override methods from the base class. The correct version is determined at runtime, so you will get different behavior depending on the object’s class.
